# My objective with this program is reproduce the logic of dotnet01/console04. That
# program is  a study in how access and build databases using Microsoft SQL Server 
# running in Docker.

# To do this, I had to add an SQL interface to Golang. So, I did:
go get github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb
# It installed the package and did not affect the current directory.
