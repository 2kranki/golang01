                Go Language Projects

I am currently learning Golang and its associated libraries in
conjunction with Docker.  So, I decided to create this repository
with code that I create.  Everything in this directory is public
domain unless stated otherwise within the file.  

Most of the projects here are operational.  Some are in-progress
and not gauranteed to work correctly.  Those are:
    console04
    console05
    gen
