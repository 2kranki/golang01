# My objective with this program is to be able to generate applications and objects
# in several languages.

# In developing this program, I have accidentally over-written the base files of
# the program several times and had to reconstruct the over-written files.  Since
# I wasn't doing commits very often, the reconstruction was sometimes a little
# painful.  Now, I am doing lots of commits. So, that any reconstruction is rather
# painless. lol  Live and learn!
