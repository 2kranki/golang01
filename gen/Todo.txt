* Clean up when done:

        * Translation of special types unique to a particular sql such as bitset in
            mssql and maybe others

        * go get <package>
        * compile and install program
        * set up database and create tables
    * genSql
        * Push the FileDefn entries on a chan and have a go function pull them off
            and execute them.  That way, we can have files generated on partial
            data such as a table.
